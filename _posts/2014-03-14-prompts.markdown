I'm not a big fan of some of the more elaborate prompts out there. Something in
me likes the bare simplicity of the prompt you get with a fresh install of
linux:

`$`

But of course you lose all the benefits of having a more comprehensive prompt.
For example, it's pretty great to know at a glance what directory you're in.

Once I discovered Zsh though, I spent a few minutes setting up exactly the
prompt I wanted. What I ended up with was this:

![zsh prompt](/img/prompt.png)

On the left hand side, the prompt is the bare minimum. `$`. It means all my
commands are lined up, regardless of how deep I am into the filesystem. And
there's something nice about the simplicity of it.

On the right hand side, I have, from left to right:

  - username@hostname, giving me context on who and where I am
  - my working directory
  - this is my favorite addition: git branch, an optional character showing
    whether or not the current repository has been edited, and the short
    version of the hash of the current commit. This is awesome. It means I
    don't need to dig into `git reflog` when I need to revert to a previous
    commit, as long as I can grab it from my history. It means I never think
    I'm running code from a clean working directory when I've actually made
    changes, or think I'm on a different branch than I actually am.

Code for the prompt is in a [gist here](https://gist.github.com/johnswanson/9562223).
To use it, you'll need to install oh-my-zsh, put this in your `~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/`
directory, and add `ZSH_THEME="[filename]"` to your `~/.zshrc` (substituting
whatever you named the theme).
