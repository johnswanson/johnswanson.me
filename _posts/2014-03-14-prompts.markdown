I'm not a big fan of some of the more elaborate prompts out there. Something in
me likes the bare simplicity of the prompt you get with a fresh install of
linux:

`$`

But of course you lose all the benefits of having a more comprehensive prompt.
For example, it's pretty great to know at a glance what directory you're in.

Once I discovered Zsh though, I spent a few minutes setting up exactly the
prompt I wanted. What I ended up with was this:

![zsh prompt](/img/prompt.png)
