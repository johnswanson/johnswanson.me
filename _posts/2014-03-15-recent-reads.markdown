# [The Blind Assassin](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385720955/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0385720955&linkCode=as2&tag=johnswansonme-20)
## Margaret Atwood
### Fiction
I originally discovered Margaret Atwood through the excellent **MaddAddam**
speculative fiction series. **The Blind Assassin** is more "literary fiction."
I love this kind of book--a slow, heavy swell with a ton of momentum that
eventually hits you *hard*. It's set in the 1930s and 40s and although Atwood's
political leanings are as evident as ever, it doesn't bash you over the head
with them as much as, say, **The Handmaid's Tale**.

# [The Internal Enemy](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393073718/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0393073718&linkCode=as2&tag=johnswansonme-20)
## Alan Taylor
### Nonfiction
[Tyler Cowen](http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2013/11/the-internal-enemy.html)
called it "one of the best history books I have read, ever." And he's read a
lot of history books. The remarkable thing about this book is the fresh
perspective it provides on the War of 1812--to white Americans, the
"Revolutionary War: Round 2" conception I had in my head was just about right.
But to slaves, the British were the ones on the side of freedom. I'd known that
the British had freed slaves as a strategy during the War of 1812 before
reading this, but it brought that fact to life in a powerful way.

# [My Struggle](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374534144/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0374534144&linkCode=as2&tag=johnswansonme-20)
## Karl Ove Knausgaard
### Memoir
Only the first two volumes are out in English so far, but these are probably
the best books I've ever read. Knausgaard puts his life on paper. Without
embellishment, raw and practically uncondensed. It's hard to read these books
without feeling a sense of communion with Knausgaard. Reading these books is
like stepping into someone else's life. There is excitement and struggle here,
but nothing that is more momentous than the struggles most of us face in our
everyday lives--struggles which are interesting to us and irrelevant and
uninteresting to almost everyone else on the face of the planet. Somehow,
Knausgaard makes us care as much about the trivia of his own life as much as we
care about our own.

# [The Hunger Games Trilogy](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0545626382/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0545626382&linkCode=as2&tag=johnswansonme-20)
## Suzanne Collins
### Fiction
Poorly written and features a plot even its target audience could see gaping
holes in a mile away. But it was gripping enough to keep me up for three nights
running to finish it. Make of that what you will, either about my willpower
or the books.
