The evidence in favor of asset price unpredictability is overwhelming. Eugene
Fama and Kenneth French repeatedly looked for evidence that mutual fund excess
returns were serially correlated--that is, that fund that outperformed the S&P
500 one year was *more likely than other funds* to outperform the S&P 500 the
next year. If investing is a skill, like playing basketball, we'd expect the
best "players" to, at the least, play somewhat better than average in the
following year. If investing is based on luck, like winning the lottery, we'd
expect the winners in one year to be no more likely than anyone else to win in
the following year. What Fama and French found was that the market behaved far
more like a lottery than a basketball game. They seemed to find a tiny amount
of skill at the upper end of the spectrum, but this was overwhelmed by mutual
fund fees.

In the face of this evidence, critics of the EMH sometimes turn to the
following argument:

> Just because the market is unpredictable does not mean that the market is
> efficient.

But this is not a reasonable claim. To see why, let's conduct a thought
experiment using TIPS--Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities. The TIPS
spread, or the difference between yield on TIPS and regular treasury
securities, is often used to
[estimate inflation expectations](http://www.clevelandfed.org/research/data/inflation_expectations/).
If I'm willing to pay $900 to get $1000 on January 1, 2016, but willing to pay
$950 to get *$1000 adjusted for inflation* on January 1, 2016, my preferences
provide a strong signal about my expectations for inflation.

So let's make the following two claims:

1. The market is unpredictable.
2. The market for TIPS is not informationally efficient. Given the same
  information as the market, it is currently possible to make *better*
  predictions about inflation than the market.

See the problem? Those two claims are mutually exclusive. The first says that
we can't predict the movement of the market. The second says that we can
predict inflation better than the market. But what determines the difference
between the "price" of a TIPS security and a regular bond *when they mature*?
The actual rate of inflation. So if we can predict inflation, *we can predict
the market as well*.
